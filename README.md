Task 02: K-Means Clustering Implementation | Machine Learning Internship at SkillCraft Technology
I have successfully completed the second task of my Machine Learning internship, which involved developing a K-Means Clustering algorithm to segment retail customers based on their purchasing behavior and income levels.

Task Objective:To implement a clustering model capable of grouping customers into distinct segments based on the following features from the Mall Customer Dataset: Annual Income (k$) ,Spending Score (1-100)

Approach and Methodology:Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine the dataset's structure and identify distribution patterns.
Visualized the relationship between Annual Income and Spending Score, differentiating customers based on gender.
-Applied the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) by analyzing the inertia values across different cluster counts.
-Implemented a K-Means Clustering model using the scikit-learn library, setting the number of clusters based on the Elbow Methodâ€™s outcome.
-Visualized the clustered segments through scatter plots, enabling clear interpretation of customer groups and purchasing patterns.

Key Outcomes:Determined the optimal number of clusters as 5, using the Elbow Method for optimal model configuration.
Successfully segmented customers into five distinct clusters, each representing unique combinations of income levels and spending behaviors.

Identified significant customer segments such as:
High income, high spending customers
High income, low spending customers
Average income, average spending customers
Low income, high spending customers
Low income, low spending customers
Created clear and interpretable visualizations of clustered groups to support data-driven marketing and customer relationship strategies.

Skills and Concepts Strengthened:
1)Practical implementation of unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
Data preprocessing and feature selection for clustering problems.
2)Application of the Elbow Method for determining optimal cluster counts.
3)Effective data visualization and interpretation of multi-dimensional clustering results.
4)Understanding of the significance of customer segmentation in business strategy and targeted marketing.

I look forward to applying more advanced machine learning techniques in the upcoming tasks, further expanding my practical knowledge in data science and analytics.
